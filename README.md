 * Count all trigrams  
 * Count the steps in between all reoccurring same trigrams  
 * Calculate the GCD of steps between each reoccurring trigrams  
 * The most frequently occurring GCD is likely the key length of the cryptogram.   
 * Spit up the string by every nth (in authors case 4th character)   
 * Calculate the frequency of the letters   
 * Calculate the Index of coincidence of each string   
 * Iterate over every letter of the English alphabet and compare the mutual index between strings “a,b”, where the second string “b” is decrypted with each letter of iterated English alphabet.    
 * If the mutual index of coincidence is relatively high, then there is a strong chance that the according shift between key letters for first and second line have a correct distance in between them.
